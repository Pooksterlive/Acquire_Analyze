## Feedback

Nice job on the organization of this repo. Your notebooks are well cleaned up, but you don't have much commentary, so it's impossible for someone to follow your insights without actually running your code. It'd be much nicer to preserve the most interesting outputs *and* write some words about them. 

I read the word document and that has a very nice write-up. I share your surprise on the token lengths. Is it just the long pauses for laughter? 

Nice work on this.
